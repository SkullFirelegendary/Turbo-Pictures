                        <br>
                        In photography there is a reality so subtle that it becomes more real than reality. There is one thing the photograph must contain, the humanity of the moment. Taking an image, freezing a moment, can reveal how rich reality truly is. Hence photography is a way of feeling, of touching, and of loving.
